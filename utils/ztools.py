def ZStructTranslator(source_dir, out_dir, overwrite=False, numChans=96, verbose=True):
    '''
    This function translates the File Logger binaries into dictionaries. Most of the work is directly taken from Scott
    Ensel's ZStructTranslator class, created in 2019-2020

    since the original .npy loading depends on loading object arrays, existing zarrays will use try to use pybmi - so need to regen them somewhere else to keep code independent
    this also means we don't need to use the .mat portions - will just recreate the zarrays from scratch and put them in the data folder as well

    Inputs:	direc:		- the directory from which to grab the data
           	overwrite:	Default: does NOT overwrite previous zstruct in folder
           				- False: to load any previous zStruct in the folder, if available
                          - True: to read .bin files and overwrite or save z struct file
                          - if overwrite is true use_py argument does not matter
              use_py:     Default: loads in .mat first
                          - False: loads in .mat file
                          - True: loads in .npy file
              numChans:   Default: 96 channels
                          - number of channels recorded on
              verbose:    Default: True
    Returns: z:         - the zstruct in zarray format. Can be treated with all the normal operations used on object np.ndarrays,
                            plus some extra functions

    NOTE: Make sure the folder path includes the entire directory structure
          with  (i.e. the name\date\run folders).
    NOTE: This script assumes that neural data is sent as variable length
          packets with an EndPacket byte of 255. It also assumes that there
          is exactly 1 feature in each neural packet.

    zstruct (dataframe):
        zstruct with trial data
    numTrials (int):
        Integer with number of trials. If higher than zstruct.shape[0], function just returns the zstruct.
